This contract is designed in a way that allows developers to easily re-configure the vault’s behavior, with minimal overrides, while staying compliant. In this guide, we will discuss some security considerations that affect ERC4626. We will also discuss common customizations of the vault.",

    "description": "ERC-4626 is a standard for tokenized vaults. Before the introduction of ERC-4626, every vault had its own distinctive specification and implementation details. This made integration difficult, error prone, and wasteful. ERC-4626 attempts to solve this problem by introducing a standard specification to lower integration efforts and create more consistent and robust implementation patterns, just like ERC-20.",
